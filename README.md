🍎 Food Waste Detection using AI/ML
📌 Overview

Food waste is one of the biggest global challenges, contributing to environmental, social, and economic issues. This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to detect, classify, and predict food waste patterns. The aim is to help reduce waste in households, restaurants, and supply chains by providing insights and detection mechanisms.

The system can:

Detect food items from images.

Identify whether the food is edible or wasted/spoiled.

Provide analytics to track and minimize food waste.

🚀 Features

📷 Image-based food waste detection using deep learning (CNN).

🧪 Classification of food items (fresh vs spoiled).

📊 Data visualization of waste trends.

⚡ Scalable training pipeline with TensorFlow/PyTorch.

🛠️ Deployment-ready for web/mobile applications.

⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-waste-detection.git
cd food-waste-detection


Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

📊 Dataset

Custom dataset of fresh vs spoiled food images.

Public datasets (e.g., Kaggle: Food Freshness Dataset
).

Augmented with rotation, brightness, and flipping to improve robustness.

🧠 Model

CNN-based architecture (ResNet50, EfficientNet, or MobileNetV2).

Trained with cross-entropy loss.

Optimizer: Adam / SGD.

Accuracy achieved: ~90% (depending on dataset).

▶️ Usage
Train the model
python src/train.py --epochs 20 --batch_size 32

Evaluate the model
python src/evaluate.py --model models/food_waste_model.pth

Run the app (Streamlit example)
streamlit run app/app.py


Upload an image → Get "Fresh" or "Spoiled" prediction.

📈 Results

Achieved high classification accuracy on test dataset.

Visualization of confusion matrix, precision-recall, and loss/accuracy curves.

Potential to integrate with IoT-based smart bins for real-world applications.

🌍 Future Work

Integration with object detection (YOLO/Faster R-CNN) for multi-food items.

Deploy model on mobile devices using TensorFlow Lite.

Real-time waste tracking dashboard for restaurants.
